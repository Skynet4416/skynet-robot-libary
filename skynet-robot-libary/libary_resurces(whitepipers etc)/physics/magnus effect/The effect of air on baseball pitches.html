This document is intended to give a brief, simplified
view of the forces which act on a baseball as it
makes its way from the pitcher's hand to home plate.
I'm aiming for an audience of high-school students,
so if you are looking for the really technical
stuff -- like airflow over stitching and the motion
of knuckleballs -- you'll be disappointed. 
But if you just want to get a feeling for the relative
sizes of gravity, drag and the Magnus force, 
read on!

<p>
</p><h4>
<a name="assume"> 
Ground rules 
</a>
</h4>

<p>
Let's make a few simplifying assumptions at
the start.

</p><ol>
<li> Air is uniform in density and temperature.
            At a temperature of T = 15 C,
            at sea level,
            at pressure of 101.325 kPa,
            its density is <b>1.225 kg/m^3</b>.
            My code, and the results quoted below,
            use a value of 1.23 kg/m^3.
            That's within the range of values one 
            can find for realistic conditions,
            but if I were starting again, I might choose 1.225.
       </li>
<li> There is no wind </li>
<li> The baseball is a smooth sphere (no stitches) </li>
<li> The coefficient of drag is a fixed value,
         not dependent on speed or spin </li>
<li> The spin on a pitch doesn't change during
         its journey from the mound to home plate </li>
<li> The drag force and the Magnus force can both be
         represented by simple functions of the 
         velocity squared of the ball </li>
</ol>

<p>
In a real baseball game, some or all of these assumptions
will be violated; 
but they will allow us to get a pretty good quantitative
understanding of the gross properties of
a curveball, for example.

</p><p>
I'm going to use a fixed setup for the release point
of the pitch:
</p><p>

<img src="./The effect of air on baseball pitches_files/dimension_f.gif" width="420" height="249">

</p><p>
The figure above shows the release point
for a right-handed pitcher.
Left-handed pitchers will release the ball exactly 2 feet
to the first-base side of the mound.
I chose this location for the release point
after looking at the measurements for several
pitchers on the
<a href="http://fastballs.wordpress.com/2008/01/14/mvn-a-pitchfx-primer/">
PITCH f/x system.</a>

</p><p>
I'll adopt a coordinate system which may seem a bit
peculiar.
It's oriented like so:
</p><p>
<img src="./The effect of air on baseball pitches_files/dimension_c.gif" width="827" height="299">

</p><p>
Why choose the <b>+z</b> axis to run towards
third base instead of first?
Well, this way, the coordinate system is
what physicists called "right-handed", 
and that means that we can use very common
mathematical conventions 
when we compute the direction of the
Magnus force.

</p><p>
I'll also adopt the following values for the
properties of a baseball and air.

</p><p>
</p><pre><font size="+1">

<a name="vacuum"> 
Pitching in a vacuum
</a>
</h4>

<p>
To begin, let's remove all the air from 
a baseball stadium
(and hope that the players have pressure suits).
In a vacuum, there will be only one force
acting on the baseball after it leaves
the pitcher's hand:
<b>gravity</b>.

</p><p>
<img src="./The effect of air on baseball pitches_files/force_grav_only.gif" width="864" height="644">

</p><p>
We can express the gravitional force on
the ball as

</p><p>
</p><center> <img src="./The effect of air on baseball pitches_files/eqn_grav.gif" width="371" height="152"> </center>

<p>
where 
<b>m</b> is the mass of the baseball,
<b>g</b> is the gravitational acceleration at the Earth's surface
(9.8 meters per second per second),
and
the <b>j-hat</b> symbol means "in the direction of the y-axis".
Since gravity pulls objects down,
this force is always in the negative y-direction.

</p><p>
</p><pre><font size="+2">

  Q:  What is the size and direction
      of the gravitational force on a baseball?


</font></pre>

<p>
<font size="-1">
<a href="http://spiff.rit.edu/richmond/baseball/traj/answer_1.txt">
 The answer 
</a>
</font>

</p><p>
When there's only a single force acting on the ball,
and that force is constant in size and direction,
the motion is particularly simple.
The ball will follow a
<b>parabolic trajectory.</b>
It's not too hard to derive two simple
equations which will yield the position of the
ball as a function of time.
If the ball has some initial position
<b>x<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub></b>
and initial velocity
<b>V<sub>0</sub></b>
oriented at an angle 
<b>&#952;</b> above the horizontal,
then its position at any time <b>t</b>
is given by

</p><p>
</p><center>
<img src="./The effect of air on baseball pitches_files/eqn_ballistic.gif" width="609" height="191">
</center>

<p>
Let's consider a relatively standard pitch:
a fastball thrown at 90 miles per hour (mph);
to be precise, thrown so that it is travelling
at 90 mph as it leaves the pitcher's hand.
The center of the strike zone should be over the 
middle of the plate and about
33 inches or 2.77 feet
above the ground
(it depends on the height of the batter, of course).
Here's the trajectory of a fastball
which ends up in the center of the strike zone,
as seen from the third-base side of the field.

</p><p>
<img src="./The effect of air on baseball pitches_files/traj_a.gif" width="720" height="504">

</p><p>
You can count the dots above to see that the
ball arrives at the plate about 0.41 seconds
after it leaves the pitcher's hand.

</p><p>
In this situation,
the pitcher must give the ball an initial angle of
<b>1.16 degrees below horizontal</b>.
When it reaches the plate, the ball will
moving a bit FASTER than it was when the
pitcher released it:
it retains all the initial horizontal speed (89.9 mph),
and it gains a bit of speed as it falls 
(ending at 10.8 mph downwards).
So the final speed is about 90.6 mph.

</p><p>
Of course, in real life, balls will slow down
as they move through the air.
Let's see how to handle drag forces next.



</p><p>
</p><hr>
<p>
</p><h4>
<a name="drag"> 
Moving against air resistance
</a>
</h4>

<p>
As the ball moves through the air,
it has to push the air out of its way.
The air, in return, pushes the ball back,
in the opposite direction.
Therefore, the direction of the drag force will always
point opposite to the instantaneous velocity.

</p><p>
<img src="./The effect of air on baseball pitches_files/force_grav_drag.gif" width="864" height="644">

</p><p>
The size of the drag force is a bit complicated:
it depends on the ball's speed.
For the relatively narrow range of speeds
of interest for pitching --
say, 60 mph to 100 mph -- 
the drag force is roughly dependent on
the SQUARE of the ball's speed.
We can write this approximation as

</p><p>
</p><center><img src="./The effect of air on baseball pitches_files/eqn_drag.gif" width="484" height="116"> </center>

&lt;&gt;
where
<pre><font size="+1">

    C<sub>D</sub>  =   drag coefficient            =  0.40

    <b>&#961;</b>   =   density of air              =  1.23     kg/m<sup>3</sup> 

    A   =   cross section area of ball  =  0.00426  m<sup>2</sup>

    v   =   velocity of ball  (m/s)

</font></pre>

<p>
and the expression
<img src="./The effect of air on baseball pitches_files/eqn_drag_a.gif" width="65" height="112" align="center">
is a mathematical way of 
writing
"in the direction of the velocity".


</p><p>
I'm adopting the 
value <b>C<sub>D</sub> = 0.40</b> 
based on results presented in 
<a href="http://webusers.npl.uiuc.edu/~a-nathan/pob/LiftDrag-1.pdf">

</p><p>
Since both the magnitude and the direction of the drag force
change as the ball moves towards home plate,
computing its effect on the trajectory takes a lot more 
work than accounting for the effect of gravity.
There is no simple set of equations which yield the
position as a function of time, alas.
However, one can still integrate the motion of
the ball numerically.  
Let's do that, and compare the motion of a 90 mph
fastball in a vacuum to the same pitch travelling 
through air.
I'll give each ball exactly the same speed and
direction as it leaves the pitcher's hand.

</p><p>
<img src="./The effect of air on baseball pitches_files/traj_b.gif" width="720" height="504">

</p><p>
There are two main differences due to the drag force:
</p><ol>
<li> The ball takes a bit longer to reach the plate.
      As you can see from the diagram, the ball moving
      through air takes an extra 3 dots = 0.03 seconds
      to reach home plate.
   </li>
<li> The ball falls a little farther during its 
      journey, simply because it takes that extra time
      to reach home plate.
      The difference in height is about
      7.6 cm = 3.0 inches.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
By the time it reaches the plate, the fastball in air isn't moving
90 mph any more.  Its horizontal speed is about 80 mph,
so 
<b>a 90 mph fastball loses about 10 mph due to air resistance</b>
by the time it reaches the batter.
This loss of speed is larger for pitches which start out
faster -- after all, the drag force does grow 
with the square of the speed.

</p><p>
</p><pre><font size="+1">

initial horizontal speed     final horizontal speed      loss
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  100 mph                          88 mph                12 mph
   90 mph                          80 mph                10 mph
   80 mph                          71 mph                 9 mph
   67 mph                          59 mph                 8 mph
----------------------------------------------------------------------
</font></pre>


<p>
Clearly, the drag force has a big effect on a baseball;
losing about 10 percent of the initial speed is a
big deal.
On the other hand, the effect of the drag force
is always the same: to delay the ball's arrival
at the plate and cause it to drop a bit.
There's nothing a pitcher can do to alter this 
behavior, which means that he can't do much to fool
a good hitter.
If only there were some way for the pitcher
to alter the ball's motion in an unpredictable way ....


</p><p>
</p><hr>
<p>
</p><h4>
<a name="spin"> 
Adding spin to the ball
</a>
</h4>

<p>
A spinning object moving through the air will experience
an additional force,
due to the the interaction of its
surface and the air:
one portion of it will be rotating WITH the air,
while another portion will be rotating AGAINST the air.
There are several ways to characterize this
interaction, and the resulting force.
For our purposes, I'll refer to it as the
<b>Magnus force</b>,
and adopt a relatively simple equation to quantify its effect:

</p><p>
</p><center> <img src="./The effect of air on baseball pitches_files/eqn_magnus.gif" width="472" height="127"> </center>

<p>
where
</p><pre><font size="+1">

    C<sub>L</sub>  =   lift coefficient            (see below)

    <b>&#961;</b>   =   density of air              =  1.23     kg/m<sup>3</sup> 

    A   =   cross section area of ball  =  0.00426  m<sup>2</sup>

    v   =   velocity of ball  (m/s)

</font></pre>

<p>
Let's wait for a moment to discuss the 
lift coefficient <b>C<sub>L</sub></b>,
and ask instead, "In which direction does the
Magnus force push the baseball?"
The last section of the equation above provides the
answer, if you know how to read vector notation:
<img src="./The effect of air on baseball pitches_files/eqn_magnus_a.gif" width="124" height="44" align="center">
means that
the direction of the Magnus force is
perpendicular to both
the ball's axis of rotation 
<img src="./The effect of air on baseball pitches_files/eqn_omega_hat.gif" width="39" height="40" align="center">
and the ball's velocity
<img src="./The effect of air on baseball pitches_files/eqn_vel_hat.gif" width="42" height="38" align="center">.

</p><p>
It will be easier to understand with a picture,
which like all the others so far is taken
from the third-base dugout, looking towards the pitcher's mound.
I'll give the ball pure backspin, so that the rotation
axis is horizontal.
</p><p>
<img src="./The effect of air on baseball pitches_files/force_grav_drag_magnus.gif" width="864" height="644">

</p><p>
With pure backspin, the rotation axis must be horizontal ... but
should the direction of 
<img src="./The effect of air on baseball pitches_files/eqn_omega_hat.gif" width="39" height="40" align="center">
point towards first base, or towards third base?
The rule is that, if you hold your right hand on the axis
and wrap your fingers around it in the direction of rotation,
your outstretched thumb points in the direction of the 
vector describing the rotation.
In this case, if we wrap the fingers of a right hand
around the ball in the figure above to match the ball's rotation,
that right hand's thumb will point towards third base.

</p><p>
Phew.

</p><p>
Once we have the directions of 
<img src="./The effect of air on baseball pitches_files/eqn_omega_hat.gif" width="39" height="40" align="center">
and 
<img src="./The effect of air on baseball pitches_files/eqn_vel_hat.gif" width="42" height="38" align="center">,
we can use the standard mathematical cross product
to determine the direction of the Magnus force.
</p><blockquote><font size="-1">
  Perhaps you'd like to read 
   <a href="http://spiff.rit.edu/classes/phys312/workshops/w2c/angmom/vec_torque.html">
       a brief review of the vector cross product? </a>
</font></blockquote>
The rule again involves one's right hand:
point your outstretched fingers so that they point along the direction
of the first vector,
<img src="./The effect of air on baseball pitches_files/eqn_omega_hat.gif" width="39" height="40" align="center">,
then orient your hand so that when you curl your fingers
to make a fist, the finger move towards the second vector,
<img src="./The effect of air on baseball pitches_files/eqn_vel_hat.gif" width="42" height="38" align="center">.
Now stretch your thumb outwards, and it will point in the
direction of the cross product.
In this case, 
that turns out to be mostly <b>upwards</b>.


<p>
Let me repeat that:
when a pitcher throws a ball with pure backspin,
the ball is pushed <b>upwards</b> as it moves
through the air.
How large is this Magnus force?
In order to calculate its size, we need to know the
value of the <b>lift coefficient C<sub>L</sub></b>.
Unfortunately,
unlike the drag coefficient, 
the lift coefficient varies quite a bit 
in ordinary baseball circumstances.
In particular, it depends on the ratio
of the rotational speed <b>V<sub>r</sub></b>
to the translational speed <b>V<sub>t</sub></b>.

</p><p>
</p><center>
<img src="./The effect of air on baseball pitches_files/rot_vs_trans.gif" width="809" height="384">
</center>

<p>
Physicists use the symbol <b>S</b>, for "spin factor",
to describe the ratio of the rotational motion
of a ball to its translational motion.

</p><p>
</p><center><img src="./The effect of air on baseball pitches_files/eqn_s_param.gif" width="392" height="132"> </center>

<p>
Recall that the radius of a baseball is <b>R = 1.45 inch = 3.683 cm</b>.
What is the rotational speed

for a baseball?

If we know the spin parameter <b>S</b> for a 
particular pitch, 
then we can figure out the lift coefficient
<b>C<sub>L</sub></b>.
Alan Nathan's article
<a href="http://webusers.npl.uiuc.edu/~a-nathan/pob/AJPFeb08.pdf">
The Effect of Spin on the Flight of a Baseball </a>
presents the results of a set of measurements
of baseballs thrown by a pitching machine
past the view of high-speed cameras.
Below is Figure 5 from his article:

</font>

</p><p>
As you can see, the lift coefficient <b>C<sub>L</sub></b>
increases as
the spin parameter <b>S</b> increases ---
but not in lockstep.
In my computations, I fit this relationship with
three linear segments;
but for rough purposes, 
one might make the simple assumption
that, over the range of spin values
of ordinary pitches (0.10 &lt; <b>S</b> &lt; 0.25),
the lift coefficient is approximately 
constant at 
<b>C<sub>L</sub></b> = 0.22.

That was a lot of work, but we are now ready 
to figure out exactly what the Magnus force
will do to some real baseballs.

Let's consider three pitches -- and rather 
simplified types of each.

</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li> 90 mph fastball with pure backspin, sort of like a 4-seam fastball </li>
<li> 80 mph changeup with pure backspin </li>
<li> 80 mph curveball with pure topspin, so it has a "12-to-6" break </li>
</ul>

<p>
Remember this equation for the Magnus force on a spinning ball?

</p><pre><font size="+1">

    C<sub>L</sub>  =   lift coefficient            =  0.22     (approximately)

    <b>&#961;</b>   =   density of air              =  1.23     kg/m<sup>3</sup> 

    A   =   cross section area of ball  =  0.00426  m<sup>2</sup>

    v   =   velocity of ball  (m/s)

</font></pre>

<p>
We can now compute the size and direction 
of the Magnus force for each pitch.
Let's start with the fastball.

</p><p>
</p><pre><font size="+1">
                                   v_t      v_t         Magnus force

  fastball        backspin        90.0     40.2       0.93       mostly up
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

</font></pre>

<p>
Look at that!  The size of the Magnus force is similar
to the size of the other two forces on the ball:

</p><ul>
<li> gravity: 1.4 Newtons (down) </li>
<li> drag: 1.7 Newtons (mostly towards the mound) </li>
<li> Magnus: 0.9 Newtons (mostly up) </li>
</ul>

<p>
We can't ignore any of these forces; in order to determine
the trajectory of a pitch accurately, 
one MUST include all three.

</p><p>
So, I wrote some code to integrate the effect of all three
forces numerically
as the ball travels from the pitcher's hand to home plate.
Let's start by comparing the motion of a
"dead" fastball -- one which doesn't spin at all,
and so feels no Magnus force, only gravity and the drag force --
to a "live" fastball -- one with a realistic
amount of backspin.
Both balls start with the same speed,
90 mph.
Both balls are given the same initial direction, 
too, 
which is chosen so that the "dead" fastball
ends up exactly in the middle of the strike zone.

</p><p>
<img src="./The effect of air on baseball pitches_files/traj_d.gif" width="720" height="504">

</p><p>
Holy mackerel!  
The backspin on a real fastball has a
MAJOR effect on its trajectory.
The spinning ball ends up about 2 feet higher
than the "dead" ball when it crosses home plate.

</p><p>
The lift given by the Magnus force to a ball with backspin
is responsible for the phrase
"a rising fastball."

<!--
Recall that the size of the Magnus force does depend on
speed of the ball
(in fact, on the speed squared),
<P>
<centeR> <img src="./magnus_force_b.gif" width=418 height=93> </centeR>

<P>
so the faster the pitch, the larger the Magnus force
and the less it falls as it travels to the plate.
A batter who is prepared for a 90 mph fastball
will misjudge a 100 mph fastball 
and swing underneath it, 
even if he manages to time the swing correctly.
-->
However, the fastball doesn't REALLY rise;
it just falls less than it would if it weren't spinning.
In order to make a pitch really rise,
one would have to be superhuman:
below is the trajectory of a pitch with
</p><ul>
<li> initial speed 110 mph </li>
<li> 3500 RPM of pure backspin </li>
<li> purely horizontal motion at time of release </li>
</ul>

<p>
<img src="./The effect of air on baseball pitches_files/traj_j.gif" width="720" height="504">

</p><p>
Of course, if one were throwing a ball with
the same size as a baseball but less mass,
then
</p><ul>
<li> the gravitational force would be smaller, but ... </li>
<li> the Magnus force (and drag force) would be the same </li>
</ul>

<p>
In that case, one might be able to throw 
a ball so that it rises quite a bit on its way
to the plate.
You can click on the picture below to see some examples
from a Wiffle Ball tournament;
I suggest starting at 2:14 from the beginning of the clip.

<p>
Let's turn to a second pitch: the changeup.
This is very similar to the fastball,
with just two differences:
</p><ul>
<li> the changeup is thrown more slowly, 80 mph instead of 90 mph </li>
<li> the changeup is thrown with less backspin, 1300 RPM instead of 
             2200 RPM </li>
</ul>

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

</font></pre>


<p>
The result is a pitch which has considerably less
lift than a fastball, so it falls more before it reaches
the plate.  
It also takes a bit more time to reach the plate, too.
For example, suppose that a pitcher throws an ordinary
fastball right through the middle of the strike zone
on the first pitch,
then switches to the changeup with exactly the same
release point and initial direction.

</p><p>
<img src="./The effect of air on baseball pitches_files/traj_e.gif" width="720" height="504">

</p><p>
Note how similar the two pitches 
appear when first released.
The second pitch takes an extra 0.06 seconds
to cross home plate, which can cause a batter
to swing too early.
It also ends up about 12 inches below the 
center of the strike zone.

<p>
Finally, let's consider a particular type of curveball:
one thrown with pure topspin.
Most real curveballs have a considerable amount of
sidespin as well, 
but let's leave that complication for later.
Our simple curve will 
</p><ul>
<li> be thrown at 80 mph </li>
<li> have 1300 RPM of <b>topspin</b> </li>
</ul>

<p>
</p><pre><font size="+1">

<p>
Topspin means that the axis of rotation points 
towards the first-base side of the field.

If we perform the cross product of

and 
<img src="./The effect of air on baseball pitches_files/eqn_vel_hat.gif" width="42" height="38" align="center">
now,
we'll find that the result points <b>mostly downwards</b>.
With two forces pushing them downwards,
curveballs drop very rapidly.
In fact, if one throws a curveball with
exactly the same initial direction as a fastball,
it won't even reach the plate!

</p><p>
<img src="./The effect of air on baseball pitches_files/traj_f.gif" width="720" height="504">

</p><p>
If you want a curveball to end up in the middle
of the strike zone, you need to give it an 
initial velocity which is slightly ABOVE
the horizontal:

<a name="disguise">
How to "disguise" a pitch
</a>
</h4>

<p>
If you look at the last figure just above, you'll see
that the trajectory of a curveball which ends up in the
middle of the strike zone is very different from that
of a fastball which ends up in the middle of the strike 
zone.  
The curveball flies upwards briefly, then gradually
descends.
When it is halfway from pitcher to batter, the 
curveball is about 14 inches higher than the fastball.
A hitter would notice that easily.
He might not be able to hit the ball, of course,
but he might at least be able to alter the timing
of his swing.

</p><p>
Suppose that a pitcher wants to keep the batter
guessing, even after the ball has left his hand.
Is there a way to "disguise" a curveball, so that
it doesn't stand out from the other pitches?
Sure -- all the pitcher has to do is alter the initial
direction of the pitch a bit.

</p><p>
Robert Adair, in his book
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Physics-Baseball-Robert-Kemp-Adair/dp/0060084367">
  The Physics of Baseball, </a>
estimates that hitters must start reacting 
to a pitch about 0.23 seconds
before it reaches the plate;
in other words, they need to make the decision
"swing or don't swing" when the ball
is roughly halfway to the plate.
Let's see what this implies for the
recognition of pitches.

</p><p>
I'll make a slight modification to Adair's value
and assume that the batter starts to react
exactly 0.23 seconds after the ball is released;
that gives another 0.22 seconds for the ball to 
reach the plate, if it's a fastball, so it's 
saying pretty much the same thing.
With a little extra practice time and a high-speed video
camera, a pitcher could figure out how
to throw the three basic pitches so that
each one is at exactly the same height at this
critical time.
I'll mark that height -- 4.7 feet -- with a 
black line in the diagram below.

</p><p>
<img src="./The effect of air on baseball pitches_files/traj_h.gif" width="720" height="504">

</p><p>
The fastball ends up in the middle of the strike zone,
reaching home plate 0.22 seconds after the batter 
starts to react.
The changeup crosses the plate 0.27 seconds
after the batter reacts,
about one foot lower than the fastball.
The curve bounces in the dirt before it
reaches the plate.

</p><p>
We can also look at these three pitches from the 
batter's point of view.  
In the figure below, dots mark the position
of each pitch in angle: the vertical scale is
"degrees above horizontal" -- so positive numbers
means the batter has to look up --
and the horizontal scale is 
"degrees away from the mound-plate line" --
so that positive numbers means the batter is
looking towards the first-base side of the mound.
The release point is at upper-left in this diagram.
</p><p>
<img src="./The effect of air on baseball pitches_files/traj_h2.gif" width="720" height="504">

</p><p>
As you can see, when the batter has to decide 
"Swing, or no swing?", 
the difference in angular position 
between the three pitches
is less than two degrees.





</p><p>
"But wait," you might object,
"this isn't a perfect disguise.
The batter can use his depth perception to notice
that these three pitches aren't all at the same
distance when they pass through that height of
4.7 feet."
Yes, you are correct.
But with a little more practice and video analysis,
the pitcher can adjust his release so that 
each one of the pitches passes through
exactly the same point in space:
4.7 feet above the ground and about 25.7 feet
away from home plate.
As the figure below shows, the curveball and
change do take a little bit longer
to reach this point.

</p><p>
<img src="./The effect of air on baseball pitches_files/traj_i.gif" width="720" height="504">

</p><p>
Now the changeup is about 6 inches below the 
fastball when it crosses the plate --
still enough to cause the bat to miss the
ball completely.
The curveball does manage to reach the plate
in the air, though it's just a few inches
off the ground.

</p><p>
Looking at these pitches from the
batter's point of view again,
the difference between them is even
smaller than it was before.

</p><hr>
<p>
</p><h4>
<a name="tilt">
Typical curves are "tilted"
</a>
</h4>

<p>
All the pitches described so far have spins which are 
very simple to describe:
pure backspin (fastball and changeup) 
or pure topspin (curve).
While these are decent approximations,
they don't resemble real pitches in one respect:
they don't allow for any <b>horizontal break</b>.

</p><p>
Why not?  Well, think about the forces on the ball:
</p><ul>
<li> gravity always pulls straight down </li>
<li> the drag force pushes opposite to the current velocity,
         and (for the most part) that is either straight towards
         home plate or down </li>
<li> the Magnus force depends on the cross product of
         the spin vector and the velocity vector; for
         pure backspin or topspin, the result is
         a purely vertical force  </li>
</ul>

<p>
But it IS possible to make a ball curve horizontally.
All we need to do is to tilt the spin axis a bit.
It will help if we look at a new sort of diagram,
one which shows the ball from center field,
looking in towards home plate, just after the ball
leaves the pitcher's hand.

</p><p>
<img src="./The effect of air on baseball pitches_files/twelve_curve.gif" width="864" height="644">

</p><p>
I've drawn a clock face around the ball as a guide
for describing the direction of spin.
This curve ball has pure topspin,
so that the portion of the ball which is rotating
fastest towards home plate is closest to 
the "12" on the clock face. 
We could call this a "twelve o'clock curveball"
if we wanted.
The Magnus force on this ball will be straight down;
you might hear the broadcaster describe this 
as a "twelve-to-six curveball."

</p><p>
But if the pitcher tilts his hand by about 30 degrees
as he releases it, we would see a somewhat different
spin orientation:

</p><p>
<img src="./The effect of air on baseball pitches_files/one_curve.gif" width="864" height="644">

</p><p>
We could call this a "one o'clock curveball" 
because the portion of the ball which spins forward
most quickly is now next to the "1 o'clock" position
in the diagram.

</p><p>
The spin direction 
<img src="./The effect of air on baseball pitches_files/eqn_omega_hat.gif" width="39" height="40" align="center">
is no longer horizontal,
but points 
</p><ul>
<li> towards the first-base side of the field (as before) </li>
<li> 30 degrees above the horizontal </li>
</ul>

<p>
That means that the direction of the Magnus force changes,
too.
Using the right-hand rule, one can compute the new direction,
given by

</p><p>
I'll compute the trajectories of
two curve balls:

</p><ul>
<li> a twelve o'clock curve which ends up in the 
          middle of the strike zone </li>
<li> a one o'clock curve which is given exactly
          the same initial velocity </li>
</ul>

<p>
If we look at these two curves from the side,
they don't appear greatly different.
Because only a portion of the Magnus force
pushes the one o'clock curve down, it doesn't
fall quite as far as the twelve o'clock curve;
but the difference is only about 3 inches.

</p><p>
<img src="./The effect of air on baseball pitches_files/traj_k.gif" width="720" height="504">

</p><p>
However, if we look at these pitches
from the catcher's point of view,
we see that the horizontal component
of the Magnus force does make quite a difference:

</p><p>
<img src="./The effect of air on baseball pitches_files/traj_l.gif" width="720" height="504">

</p><p>
The horizontal break on the one o'clock curve
pushes it out to the very edge of the strike zone,
about 11 inches from the center of the plate.
I've drawn a strike zone which is
based on the width of home plate (8.5 inches
to each side of the center),
plus an additional width of one ball diameter
on each side (another 2.9 inches)

</p><p>
From the pitcher's point of view, this ball breaks
from upper-right to lower-left as it approaches
the batter. 
The pitcher might reasonably describe this as 
"a one o'clock to seven o'clock curveball".

</p><p>
Don't forget that a typical pitcher will release the 
ball about two feet to the side of the mound;
I've drawn the flight of a ball thrown by 
a right-handed pitcher in the figure above.

</p><h4>
<a name="rightylefty">
The difference between pitches thrown by righties and lefties
</a>
</h4>

<p>
When managers make up their lineups for each game,
they pay quite a bit of attention to the 
opposing pitcher.  In general, if the opposing pitcher
throws with his left hand, the manager will try to
fill his lineup with batters who stand in the
box on the third-base side of home plate
(right-handed hitters);
if the opposing pitcher throws with his
right hand, the manager will insert batters
who stand on the first-base side of home plate
(left-handed batters).  Why?

</p><p>
The answer has two parts.

</p><ul>
<li> The "typical" breaking ball thrown by a pitcher
          will move <i>horizontally</i>
          in one particular direction;
          that direction depends on which hand
          throws the ball. </li>
<li> The "typical" batter has an easier
          time hitting pitches which are
          located on one particular side
          of the plate. </li>
</ul>

<p>
Let's look at the pitching half of this story.

</p><p>
Recall from the previous section that if a pitcher throws a
curveball by giving the ball topspin, and holds the ball so
that the top of the rotation is at one o'clock

</p><p>
<img src="./The effect of air on baseball pitches_files/one_curve.gif" width="864" height="644">

</p><p>
then, compared to a ball thrown with no sidespin,
this ball will slide towards the first-base side
of home plate:

</p><p>
<img src="./The effect of air on baseball pitches_files/traj_l.gif" width="720" height="504">

</p><p>
So, just how easy is it for a pitcher to hold and
release the ball so that the top of the spin 
is located at one o'clock?
Let's look at a right-handed pitcher as he 
is about to release the ball,
in a view taken by the center-field camera.


</p><p>
The pitcher's hand holds the third-base side of the 
ball.  If his arm angle at the release were vertical,
directly over his head, then when he snapped his 
wrist forward, he would give the ball pure topspin.
Most pitchers, like the one shown above, have
more of a "three-quarters" arm angle: they hold 
their arms both up and towards the side.  
In this situation, the pitcher holds the ball
so that it is cupped slightly from below,
as well as being held from the third-base side.
At a right-handed pitcher snaps his wrist forward,
he gives the ball both topspin and some sidespin:
the top of the spinning motion is tilted to the
third-base side.

</p><p>
<img src="./The effect of air on baseball pitches_files/righty_throws.gif" width="650" height="643">

</p><p>
Thus, when a right-handed pitcher throws a curveball,
the top of the spinning ball will be tilted
towards the one o'clock side.
As a result, his curveball will both
</p><ul>
<li> curve down relative to a ball thrown with no spin </li>
<li> break towards first base, relative to a ball thrown with no spin </li>
</ul>

<p>
On the other hand, when a right-handed pitcher throws
a fastball, his grip is different:
he lets the ball roll off his fingers as
he pushes it forward.
That gives the ball backspin, again with 
a tilt in the same direction.

</p><p>
<img src="./The effect of air on baseball pitches_files/righty_fastball.gif" width="734" height="643" <p="">
So when a right-handed pitcher throws a fastball,
the top of the back-spinning ball will be tilted
towards the one o'clock side.
As a result, his fastball will both
</p><ul>
<li> stay up relative to a ball thrown with no spin </li>
<li> break towards third base, relative to a ball thrown with no spin </li>
</ul>



<p>
As an example, consider these pitches thrown 
by right-hander Daisuke Matsuzaka during the
2009 World Baseball Classic, in a game against
Cuba.
This (and following) graphics come from the 
wonderful 
<a href="http://brooksbaseball.net/pfx/">
Pitch FX tool on brooksbaseball.net </a>.
The graph shows the speed of each pitch on 
the vertical axis (fast at the top, slow at the
bottom),
and the amount of horizontal motion 
relative to a ball with no spin on the
horizontal axis.
The graph shows motion from the catcher's point
of view, so first base is to the right
and third base to the left.

</p><p>
<img src="./The effect of air on baseball pitches_files/matsuzaka_3_15_2009.gif" width="702" height="500">

</p><p>
Let me add a few notes to this picture, and identify the
different pitches.

</p><p>
<img src="./The effect of air on baseball pitches_files/matsuzaka_label.gif" width="722" height="520">

</p><p>
The easiest pitches to recognize are the fastball --
it's the fastest, of course! -- and the changeup,
which ends up in nearly the same horizontal location
as the fastball, but moves more slowly.
The clump of points at lower right might be called
either "curves" or "sliders", depending on how
much they break and how fast they are.
Curves go slower and have a larger break,
while sliders move less and go faster.
The group of pitches near the center,
with little horizontal motion and thrown at
86-90 mph, are "cut fastballs", or "cutters."

</p><p>
Now, for a left-handed pitcher, everything goes in 
the opposite direction.
The slight tilt applied to an ordinary curveball
will go in the opposite direction,
just because a left-handed pitcher's arm is
tilted towards the first-base side of the 
field, rather than the third-base side
of the field.
A lefty's curve will break towards the
third-base side of the plate.

</p><p>
<img src="./The effect of air on baseball pitches_files/curves_sidebyside.gif" width="1084" height="643">

</p><p>
Likewise, the slight tilt applied to an ordinary 
fastball by a left-handed pitcher will cause it to 
break towards FIRST base, not third base.

</p><p>
As an example, consider left-handed pitcher Jon Lester's
start against the Minnesota Twins on July 8, 2008.

</p><p>
<img src="./The effect of air on baseball pitches_files/lester_7_8_2008.gif" width="701" height="500">

</p><p>
Note how this distribution is basically the mirror-image
of Matsuzaka's: fastballs are in the upper-RIGHT corner
(instead of upper-left), and breaking stuff is
in the lower-LEFT corner (instead of lower-right).
Let me add some labels again:

</p><p>
<img src="./The effect of air on baseball pitches_files/lester_label.gif" width="721" height="520">

</p><p>
I'm calling the clump of pitches with speed 86-90 mph
and a slight movement towards third base "cut fastballs",
but one might also label them "sliders", I suppose.

</p><p>
One way to contrast the two pitchers is to put all their
pitches on a single graph.
I apologize for the somewhat washed-out appearance of this
composite, but at least it does the job.
Matsuzaka's pitches are in black, Lester's in red.

</p><p>
<img src="./The effect of air on baseball pitches_files/lester_matsu_label.gif" width="721" height="520">

</p><p>
Lester's pitches have a greater range of speeds, 
from a 4-seam fastball at about 95 mph to a very slow curve
at about 74 mph -- a 21-mph difference.
Matsusaka can only manage a 16-mph difference between
his best fastball and slowest changeup.
On the other hand, Matsuzaka's horizontal range
of motion is about 19 inches, while Lester's is
only 16 inches.
Perhaps one might describe Lester as a "power" pitcher,
while Matsuzaka might be more of a "breaking-ball" pitcher.

</p><p>
Okay, to summarize,

</p><ul>
<li> right handed pitchers, in general, throw
       <ul>
       <li> fastballs that break towards the third base side </li>
       <li> curves that break towards the first base side </li>
       </ul>
   </li>
<li> left handed pitchers, in general, throw
       <ul>
       <li> fastballs that break towards the first base side </li>
       <li> curves that break towards the third base side </li>
       </ul>
   </li>
</ul>

<p>
What about hitters?  Which pitches give them the most trouble?
I'm not a baseball player, but from the constant attempt of
defenses to match a lefty pitcher against a lefty batter,
and vice versa, we can conclude that
<b>batters have more difficulty hitting curves and sliders which
break AWAY from them. </b>

</p><p>
If this is true, then one might expect to see some
correlation between the range of horizontal motion
in a pitcher's arsenal and the difference in his
performance against batters on opposite sides of
the plate.  
That is, a right-handed pitcher whose curves break very strongly 
in the horizontal plane might do very much BETTER
against right-handed batters than he does against left-handed
batters,
while a right-handed pitcher with only a small horizontal
break might not show such a difference.

</p><p>
Just for fun (since a proper test would involve
many, many pitchers, not just two), let's test this theory against
the two pitchers I've used in this example:
Lester and Matsuzaka.  
Since Lester's horizontal range is smaller than
Matsuzaka's, we might guess that his "split"
between right-handed and left-handed batters would
be smaller.
I grabbed data for the 2008 season 
from

<p>
Well, each pitcher does have a platoon split in
the predicted manner -- so that's good.
But Lester's split is larger than Matsuzaka's,
despite Lester's smaller horizontal range.
Obviously, there's a lot more to pitching than
how much spin one can put on a ball ...
